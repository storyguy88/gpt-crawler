Hummingbird Documentation
Documentation for Hummingbird the lightweight, flexible, modern server framework.
Hummingbird
Hummingbird is a lightweight and flexible web application framework. It provides a router for directing different endpoints to their handlers, middleware for processing requests before they reach your handlers and processing the responses returned, custom encoding/decoding of requests and responses, TLS and HTTP2.
If you’re new to Hummingbird, start here: 
Build a Todos application.
import
 Hummingbird

// create router and add a single GET /hello route

let
 router 
=

Router
()

    .get(
"hello"
) { request, 
_
 -> 
String

in

return

"Hello"

    }

// create application using router

let
 app 
=

Application
(router: router)

// run hummingbird application

try

await
 app.runService()

Below is a list of guides and tutorials to help you get started with building your own Hummingbird based web application.
